  <h1>Founder’s Story</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      William Timothy Fininen was shaped by the trials of trauma, survival, and displacement, yet emerged with an unshakable purpose — to protect others who have been forgotten, harmed, or lost within systems of silence and neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a young age, he experienced deep disruption, navigating through broken family structures, exploitation, and institutional systems. These experiences, while painful, opened his empathic gift — a connection to others’ pain that would later define his life's mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than allowing his circumstances to consume him, William transformed his hardship into fuel for community action and ancestral honoring. He pursued education, found spiritual grounding, and chose to create safe spaces for those in need of shelter and recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lakwalahal Foundation is his soul’s work — a sacred vessel of healing and justice, rooted in bloodline, experience, and an unwavering call to protect the sacred and the silenced.
